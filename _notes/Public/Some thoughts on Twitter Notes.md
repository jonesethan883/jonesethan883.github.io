Twitter has a new feature called Notes. It lets you write blog posts on Twitter which will appear in a separate tab on your profile and can of course be linked to from a tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">✨ Introducing: Notes ✨<br><br>We’re testing a way to write longer on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/SnrS4Q6toX">pic.twitter.com/SnrS4Q6toX</a></p>&mdash; Twitter Write (@TwitterWrite) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterWrite/status/1539640956915290112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I think this is an OK idea, but it has some flaws.
They’re recognizing a common dynamic where people write posts on medium/their own site/whatever and link to them on Twitter to promote them, and they’ve very reasonably thought ‘well, medium is a pretty basic platform, why not just do that ourselves'. 
But I think they’ve restricted themselves by treating it as a Blogging platform which I don't think is going to integrate as well as it could with Twitter proper.

## Blogs? Like for losers?

One of the neat things about social media is that it has this ability to trick people into writing. 
People who would never write a Blog Post or an Essay are perfectly capable of writing Tumblr posts or Twitter threads or Reddit comments that end up being thousands of words long.
[[E.g. I wrote the first draft of this article in a Discord server::rmn]]
They get really familiar with using the format from lots of low and medium effort content that feels very low stakes compared to writing a blog post which I think makes people feel more self conscious- 
"Who am I to be putting my random thoughts in an article with a title and going around asking people to read it?''
And that restricts the potential.
[[I don't have any good ideas on how you could overcome this without just sacrificing the character limit entirely, which would obviously not be tenable for Twitter. Maybe some sort of prompt which asks people if they want to turn a thread into a Note once it gets long enough?::lmn]]
On Tumblr e.g. there's a common dynamic where someone will post a meme about dinosaurs and then a paleontologist will respond with a 2,000 word post about some real topic relevant to the meme. 
I don’t think you could get that with Notes.

## Who Tweets and why
As I see it there are two relevant classes of Twitter users who might use this feature: Brands and Professionals.
Brands could be actual brands like Wendy's or individual brands like celebrities all the way down to the lowest form of Brand and the highest form of Professional, the Thought Leader. 
For the Brand, Twitter is mainly a PR platform. 
They make announcements, advertise, and drive fans to the things that actually make them money.

For the Professional, Twitter functions as a professional network. 
This is an important but not very visible function. 
Professional Twitter is where you see a lot of people who are relatively normal, 25-35 with good jobs. 
Often their profile is attached to their real name or at least .
[[I'm reminded of the way scientific journals evolved from just professional scientists and doctors writing and publishing letters to one another about things they've noticed in their line of work to a Prestigous and Official Venue for Publishing Articles. Nowadays to hear the relatively unfiltered thoughts of professionals musing on things that affect them I'd most likely go to Twitter.::lmn]]
They use Twitter the way it was originally intended, a microblogging tool. They share thoughts about what life is like in their corner of the world, do short threads about their work and interests, and follow people doing something similar. 
And this ends up being the memetic layer for a lot of different professions, especially tech professions.

Right now notes have a very limited space in this hierarchy.
Low and mid level Professionals are going to be too self conscious to use a note with the feeling that it's a presumptive Act of Publishing. 
High level brands will prefer to use their own websites and just post links on Twitter like they've always done. 
So the only users are the low level Brands and high level Professionals. 
This is the same demographic that's currently migrating to Substack. 
[[Twitter has also been coming for Substack in the form of email newsletters, however I've found that the people using these newsletters tend to be slightly higher level than the people who make Substacks. Perhaps this is because associating a newsletter so strongly with a Twitter account, which serves as a lot of people's canonical online identity, necessitates being an Individual Brand. People are willing to put their name on their Substacks, but might be more hesitant to promote their Twitter newsletter as a core part of their identity::rmn]]

## The Twitter Notes is the message

Ultimately I don’t think blogging platforms are a very sustainable idea.
Like why did Medium explode when we already had WordPress? 
And why did Substack explode when we already had Medium?
They both had some unique advantages, but I think a big part of it is just novelty and prestige.
By the time Medium came around Wordpress blogs had started to have a cheap feel to them. 
Anybody can start them so eventually anybody did, and 90% of interactions with Wordpress blogs left a sour taste in your mouth.
[[Actually this wasn’t as much a problem for Wordpress because Wordpress wasn’t as opinionated. Both literally not opinionated in that the sites you make with it are very free form, and non opinionated in the sense that it’s so universal you can’t have an association with it in the same way you don’t have a particular bias for or against a book because it’s printed on paper. But there’s very little middle ground between “So specific it will deliver reliably good content” and “So general you won’t judge the medium for the content that appears on it”. It’s going to be hard to scale Notes up to a level where it can be an invisible goblet without getting a negative association from the content being unfiltered for quality::rmn]] 

But then Medium came out with all this Tasteful Professional Looking Minimalism.
For a while at the beginning you had to [[remind people::https://medium.com/@drewkaufman/anyone-can-write-anything-on-medium-com-so-please-consider-my-opinion-60f33d017476]] that Medium was just a blog platform where anyone could post anything, and not an actual magazine or newspaper.[[Matthew Butterick has an <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html">insightful article</a> on the design and ethics of Medium. Much of it also applies to Notes::lmn]]

> Did you know that anyone can write anything on Medium.com? Then when someone shares your work to another website, it will look like a real, legitimate article? You can type whatever you like and people will think that your work was vetted by an editorial process. You can confuse anyone into believing your writing was deemed worthy of publication by another human being. Someone is bound to see your article and think, “oh, this is a real piece of journalism because here it is on a shiny website.”

But of course it didn't stay cool forever. It went from the platform of choice for funky tastemakers hip enough to know it existed and care about it's design choices to being filled with all the mediocrity that makes up [[90% of everything::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law]]
I can't speak to a general sentiment, but nowadays seeing that an article is published on Medium leaves me with the same taste I used to get from those default theme WordPress or Blogger blogs.
It feels low effort, and has associations with all the low effort SEO bait content I've seen on the same website.
That's not to say that I won't read an article just because it's on Medium, or that there aren't lots of great articles and writing published on it, only that the format doesn't do the content any favors.

So now that Medium has a tired reputation all those tastemakers are starting to move to Substack. Both used the strategy of paying prestigous writers to move their content to the platform and build its reputation before throwing the doors open to the masses. Presumably Substack will end up meeting the same fate as Medium. Twitter notes may not even get off the ground- any amount of prestige would be fighting against the existing Twitter brand.
