Really fantastic. I'm surprised the response has been so ambivalent. I've heard it described like it's a very artsy movie bordering on inacessible, but I don't agree with that at all. The story is thematically rich but not difficult to follow, and there's enough action and interesting stuff happening that you're not going to be bored.

The depiction of magic was really standout. It was natural and in line with how magic would have actually been perceived at the time which I think made it feel more authentic than most fantasy magic like you'd see in Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones or something.
