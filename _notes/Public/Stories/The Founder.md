It was early morning, in the Spring. I had to get up at five to make my appointment with The Founder. He had insisted that we meet early. On the phone I asked him if this was because he got up early every day but he laughed and said no. He explained that he was scheduling the meeting in a way that would cause mutual frustration. "The problem" he said "with most innovators is that they are self-defeating. They imagine the wonderful things that they or others could accomplish if only they were free of this or that inconvenience and they do their greatest work in an attempt to fix it. But the more sufficient they find things the less innovative they can be. But to be clear this is not a change mediated by the real level of satisfaction in their lives. It is a fetishistic process. That is to say a general dissatisfaction is transformed into an *individual* problem, and the solution to that individual problem is transformed into a general satisfaction, but only for those who chose this particular problem as the fetish-object of their frustration. This process cannot be stopped but it can be slowed. In order to continue innovation it is necessary to maintain a highly general degree of dissatisfaction which can be harnessed for, but not fixed by, practical solutions."

I had pondered this idea in the interim. He was, I decided, incorrect. Empirically speaking most innovation doesn't come from the most dissatisfied, it comes from the comfortable. One could point to examples of particular innovators who did nothing noteworthy after their greatest innovation, but this is expected by regression to the mean. Nonetheless I kept it in mind. Even a flawed insight should be treated as valuable when it comes from the mind of a man such as The Founder.

"Let's make a distinction here" said The Founder "between an equal process and an equitable process."

He bobbed his head forward and down as he said this, raising his eyebrows slightly. I wondered for a second if I should respond but he continued.

"Equity and employment are contradictions you understand. The problem we're facing is that we have equity as an external imposition on a process that measures equally. The difference here is to internalize the equity- remove the contradiction by using the equity as a tool."

"If you'll excuse my radical honesty, I'm not sure I'm picking up what you're putting down. Can you hit me with an example?"

"No ish, I appreciate the realness. Imagine if you will a core-competency powered strategically aligned initiative emphasizing real growth by gordian-knot style bypassing of a wicked problem vs a thoroughly *non*-aligned vanity initiative kept alive by top-down fiat. What is the *equal* and the *equitable* process for evaluation towards relative resource allocation?"

"I suppose the equal process would be to allocate resources equally where the equitable process allocates more towards the better project."

"On the contrary. The fundamental weakness of the second proposition, targeting an equal outcome, necessitates greater investment. But what most fail to consider is the sign of the investment, the nature of the equity in your equity"

"You've lost me"

"Negative investment in a negative product generates positive returns. By investing in equitable processes *with* the efforts of *other* equitable processes, we create a network of consistent failure. Are you a believer in pareto optimization?"

"Of course"

"Then let me ask you this. What is the precondition for meta-pareto efficacy? How do we scale our mechanism for reaping long-tail gains from 20% to 4% to 0.8%? Traditional answers are to increase the size of the pyramid, which is necessary but not sufficient, or to attempt to filter out the productive 20%. Both those methods involve sifting through bad results looking for good ones. Our process is a a sponge that soaks up the bad. The error is in thinking of high investment in poor initiatives as an inevitable failure of a discrimination algorithm operating in a high risk/reward uncertain environment, rather than making the effort to deliberately *seek out* and *grow* failure as a way of creating a clearer delineation between stagnant and breakout elements within your existing pool."

"You're talking about evolutionary pressure?"

"I'm talking about *ontological* pressure. About an incompatibility of *being*. A prion disease structurally collapsing everything that can connect to it."
