One of the ideas American Psycho works to get across is that Patrick Bateman sucks so hard it’s not even funny. When he's first introduced he seems to play into the trope of an aloof successful psychopath, but then it’s progressively revealed how pathetic he is. He’s not good at business, his dad owns the company and he spends his work day watching Jeopardy. He’s not good at schmoozing, people dislike him or don’t even recognize him. He pays $25 for a cocktail because his drink tickets aren’t valid and calls the bartender a bitch after she turns her back. And if he was a loser in all those areas but was actually a serial killer that at least would be cool in a badass way. But he’s a guy who is a loser and _fantasizes_ about being a serial killer. It feels at first like he’s making a trade off where he’s exchanged his compassion and humanity for this composed hyper competent alternate identity, but he doesn’t even get that. He’s not a psychopathic wolf hiding under a suit, he just _is_ the suit. And the haircut and the glasses and the Walkman and the women all of which he fantasizes can make him that wolf. He wants to be Patrick Bateman in exactly the same way all those guys on the Internet do, and he achieves it in exactly the same way they would. Consumer spending and constant fantasy. 

> “There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.”
